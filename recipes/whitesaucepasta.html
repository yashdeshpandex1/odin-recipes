        <p>This White Sauce Pasta is an easy weeknight meal that’s ready under 30 minutes. 
            You will love this rich, creamy & saucy White Pasta, perfectly seasoned with 
            Italian herbs & topped with red chili flakes. It is lighter and not heavy and 
            is a satisfying vegetarian comfort food. You can make this plain or with mixed 
            vegetables, chicken or shrimp according to your preference. </p>

        <ul> <strong> Ingredients: </strong> 
            <li> 1 cup (100 grams) pasta (penne or macaroni) </li>
            <li> 1½ cup milk (full fat or plant milk) </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons butter + ½ tablespoon oil or butter (to sauté veggies) </li>
            <li> ¼ cup heavy cream or 2 to 3 tablespoons cheese (optional, parmesan, cream cheese, mozzarella or cheddar) </li>
            <li> 1½ tablespoon all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon black pepper (crushed or ground, adjust to taste) </li>
            <li> 2 garlic cloves grated (optional, can use 1 teaspoon to tablespoon as per preference) </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon oregano (or dried mix Italian herbs) </li>
            <li> salt as needed </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon red chili flakes (optional, adjust to taste) </li>
        </ul>

        <ol> <strong> Steps: </strong>
            <li> Bring 4 cups of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add pasta and ¼ teaspoon salt. </li>
            <li> Cook on a medium high flame till al dente. Check the instructions on the pasta package
                 for the correct cook time. Check them a minute earlier than mentioned on the package. 
                 They must be tender, firm and chewy but not mushy. Mine takes about 9 mins. </li>
            <li> Reserve about ¼ cup pasta cooked stock <li>
            <li> Drain the pasta to a colander. Cover and keep aside. </li>
            <li> Pour ½ tbsp oil or butter to a pan. Add the vegetables and
                 sauté them on a medium high heat until slightly tender yet crunchy. 
                 This takes me about 5 to 6 mins. Remove to a plate and set aside. </li>
            <li> Melt 2 tablespoons butter and add minced garlic (optional) and fry
                 for 30 to 40 seconds on a medium heat. </li>
            <li> Stir in all-purpose flour. </li>
            <li> Saute well until the flour loses the raw smell, for about a minute.
                 Don’t brown the flour. Since this is a small quantity, the roux can become 
                 dry and clumpy. It’s just fine. Turn off the stove/heat and slowly pour ½ cup milk 
                 while you stir to incorporate the milk into the roux. </li> 
            <li> Keep whisking till it looks creamy & uniform to prevent forming lumps. 
                 Pour the rest of the milk and stir well. </li>
            <li> Turn on the heat and cook on a medium-low until the white sauce becomes thick.
                 Keep stirring/whisking & scrape the sides for a uniform sauce through out. </li>
            <li> Pour the heavy cream or cheese and mix well. </li>
            <li> The white sauce is done perfectly when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. 
                 Alternately you can draw a finger/line through the coated spoon. 
                 The sauce should wipe clean and leave a space, meaning it is thick enough. </li>
            <li> Add the vegetables and the cooked pasta & mix well. </li>
            <li> Add pepper, oregano (or mixed Italian herbs) and chili flakes. 
                 You can also add a pinch of ground nutmeg if you want. If the sauce looks too thick
                 (as it cools down), add 2 tbsps of the reserved stock so the sauce loosens a bit. </li>
            <li> Garnish white sauce pasta with red chilli flakes and crushed black pepper. 
                 Serve it hot or warm as the sauce thickens more when it cools down. </li>
        </ol>
