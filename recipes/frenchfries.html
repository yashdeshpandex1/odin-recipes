        <p> French Fries are arguably the perfect snack or side dish when you are craving something crisp, 
            salty, savory, and satisfying. In this post I share the easiest way to make perfectly crisp 
            French fries each time you make. Tossed in a special shaker seasoning, these French fries 
            make one of the best and super addictive snack. I also share the steps for oven baked and air fryer French fries. </p>

        <ul> <strong> Ingredients: </strong> 
            <li> Potatoes </li>
            <li> Cooking oil </li>
            <li> Salt </li>
            <li> Black pepper </li>
        </ul>

        <ol> <strong> Steps: </strong> 
            <li>let's wash our potatoes really well. After they are washed you can peel them if you like.
                 I don't peel mine. It's just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Now it is time to cut the potatoes into our fry shape. I have a handy fry cutter that I really like.
                 It saves a bunch of time, but you can certainly just use a knife. </li>
            <li> Next we place our potatoes cuts into a large bowl with really cold water. Make sure to add a couple
                 of tsp. of salt as well. Why do we do this? This process helps to remove that starch from those
                  potatoes, resulting in a much tastier french fry. We want to soak them for about 20 minutes. </li>
            <li> While our potatoes are soaking let's go ahead and get our oil started. I am using a deep fryer,
                 which I really like, however a pot and candy thermometer will work just fine.
                  We want to heat our oil for the "first fry" to 320 degrees F. (160 C) </li>
            <li> Next we drain the water from the potatoes and place them on a paper towel.
                 We use another paper towel to pat them dry. We want them fairly dry,
                  because water and hot oil do not play nice together. :) </li>
            <li> Now we place a small batch of potatoes into our deep fryer or pot and fry them on a lower heat around
                 320 degrees F (160 C) for 4 to 6 minutes until they are blonde in color. You will probably need to
                 wait a few minutes after a few batches and let the oil come back up to temperature.
                 Once they are done place them on a paper towel to dry, then in freezer bags or tupperware,
                 so we can freeze them. If you don't have time to freeze them, you can go to the next step.
                 I like to freeze mine so I can make a ton up front, and then freeze the ones I am not going to eat to fry up later. </li>
            <li> Now once we have frozen our fries, let's turn up our heat to 400 to 425 degrees F. (205 C to 218 C).
                 Of if you deep fryer doesn't go that high, put it on its highest setting.
                 Then comes our "Second" fry or "High Heat" fry. Take a batch of fries and place them in the hot oil,
                 this time we will only be frying them for around a minute or so, until they turn a nice golden brown.
                 Take them out and place them on a paper towel to drain the excess oil off and salt them fries up! We are done, enjoy!! </li>
        </ol>
